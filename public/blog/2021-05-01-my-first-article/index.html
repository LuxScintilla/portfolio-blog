    <p>The building blocks of HTML5, which is an open web platform, include the following key elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semantic Structure</li>
<li>Multimedia Support</li>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</li>
<li>Offline Storage</li>
<li>Enhanced Forms</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML5 is a markup language that provides a rich set of features for building web applications. Its building blocks consist of several essential components. Firstly, HTML5 emphasizes semantic structure, allowing developers to use meaningful tags and elements to describe the content, enhancing accessibility and search engine optimization. Secondly, HTML5 provides native support for multimedia, including audio and video elements, eliminating the need for third-party plugins like Flash. Additionally, the canvas element enables dynamic rendering and manipulation of graphics and animations using JavaScript. HTML5 also incorporates Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for high-quality resolution-independent graphics. It offers offline storage capabilities, allowing web applications to store data locally and work offline. Finally, HTML5 introduces enhanced form elements, such as new input types, form validation, and date pickers, improving user experience and simplifying form handling.</p>
<p>Collectively, these building blocks of HTML5 contribute to its versatility, interactivity, and multimedia capabilities, enabling developers to create engaging web applications and experiences.</p>
